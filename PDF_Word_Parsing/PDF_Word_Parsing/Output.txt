THE BOY WHO CRIED WOLF

Once there was a shepherd boy who had to look after a flock of
sheep One day he felt bored and decided to play a trick on the
villagers He shouted “Help Wolf Wolf”

The villagers heard his cries and rushed out of the village to help
the shepherd boy When they reached him they asked
“Where is the wolf”

The shepherd boy laughed loudly “Ha Ha Ha I fooled all of you
I was only playing a trick on you”

A few days later the shepherd boy played this trick again

Again he cried “Help Help Wolf Wolf” Again the villagers rushed up the hill to help him and
again they found that boy had tricked them They were very angry with him for being so naughty

Then some time later a wolf went into the field The wolf attacked one sheep and then another
and another The shepherd boy ran towards the village shouting “Help Help Wolf Help
Somebody”

The villagers heard his cries but they laughed because they thought it was another trick The boy
ran to the nearest villager and said “A wolf is attacking the sheep I lied before but this time it is
true”

Finally the villagers went to look It was true They could see the wolf running away and many
dead sheep lying on the grass

We may not believe someone who often tells lies even when he tells the truth
